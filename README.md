# Spam Filter-ML Classification-Python-Gradio

### Project Description
This repository contains the code for a Spam Filter, a machine-learning project designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of spam and non-spam emails. Various supervised classification algorithms are implemented using Scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook, and a pipeline is created using CountVectorizer and Naive Bayes for efficient text classification. The selected model is then deployed using Gradio, providing a user-friendly interface for spam detection.
